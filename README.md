   -- Standardized columns (e.g., `Sex`, `Fentanyl`) by removing extra spaces and normalizing text.
   -- Handled missing values for columns like `Age` and `Sex`.
   
2. **Analysis and Visualization**
   -- Gender distribution across top 10 residence counties using bar charts.
   -- Trends in substance usage over the years with normalized line plots.
   -- Distribution of incidents across age groups, split by gender, using histograms.
   -- Correlation analysis of demographics and substance usage through heatmaps.
   -- Comparative analysis of drug-related deaths with other causes, like accidents and suicides.

3. **Insights**
   -- Peak age group: 40–60 years.
